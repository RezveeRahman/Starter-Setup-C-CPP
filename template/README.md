# Template folder
**A quick word:** This file has nothing to do with C++ templates. \
It is merely just a folder where we have some boiler-plate code. \
If you are planning to use headers file for C++ only, use `.hpp` \
instead of `.h`. The exception to this is that if you plan using \
`.h` file for both C (or C only) and C++.
